# DIA Lift Station Monitoring System

## Target Functionality for POC

### Monitoring Lift Stations
Ensuring the optimal performance of lift stations is essential to prevent overflow incidents.  
This involves real-time tracking of pump operations, flow rates, and system pressures to maintain smooth and efficient wastewater management.

A lift station is a critical component in a wastewater management system, designed to move wastewater from lower to higher elevations.  
This is particularly necessary when the natural slope of the terrain is not sufficient for gravity flow.  
The lift station typically consists of a wet well, pumps, motors, and control systems.

Wastewater flows into the wet well, and when it reaches a certain level, pumps are activated to lift the wastewater through a pressurized pipe system to a higher elevation, where it continues its journey to a treatment facility or another lift station.

### Pumps and Motors
Monitoring the performance of pumps and motors is crucial.  
This includes tracking parameters like **vibration**, **temperature**, and **power consumption** to predict failures and schedule maintenance proactively.

---

### Wet Well Levels
Keeping an eye on the wet well levels helps manage the inflow and outflow of wastewater.  
Sensors can detect **high or low levels** and trigger alarms to prevent overflows or dry running of pumps.

---

## Flow Rates
Measuring the flow rates of incoming and outgoing wastewater can help assess the **efficiency** of the lift station and detect any **blockages** or **leaks**.

---

## Environmental Conditions
Tracking environmental conditions such as **temperature**, **humidity**, and **gas levels** (e.g., methane or hydrogen sulfide) can help maintain a safe working environment and prevent hazardous situations.

### Gas Levels

#### Considerations
Monitoring gas levels in waste lift stations (sewage pumping stations) requires specialized sensors capable of detecting gases commonly found in such environments, such as:

- **Hydrogen Sulfide (H₂S)**: Produced by organic matter decomposition; highly toxic.
- **Methane (CH₄)**: Flammable and explosive.
- **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)**: Can displace oxygen in confined spaces.
- **Oxygen (O₂)**: Low levels can indicate an unsafe environment.

**Sensor Durability:** Waterproof (**IP65 or higher**) and corrosion-resistant.  
**Maintenance:** Regular sensor calibration and replacement.

## Solution Criteria

- **Power Requirements:** Provide power for sensors and local hub/gateway.
- **Power Limitations:** Solution should consider the limited availability of power outlets where sensors need to be deployed.
- **Device Durability:** Solution should be ruggedized for harsh environments.
- **Network Connectivity:** Solution should use **Wi-Fi** as its primary network.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** The solution should incorporate ML algorithms to identify standard operations and generate alerts for any deviations from the norm.
